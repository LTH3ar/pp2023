update: 16/02/2023
After having more time for this program, I made an improved version of this program
1.student.mark.improved.py

changes:
1. instead of storing mark in student list, I store it in course list
2. no limit for number of student & course
3. add function to display course list separately

the reason I don't commit it directly to the original program is because one of the requirement is to input number of
students & courses in the beginning of the program which in the improved version is not needed anymore.


update: 17/02/2023
Based on the improved version, update the original program so that it follow the steps required in lab1
