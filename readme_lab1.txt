This program have 2 list student & course
The mark of student is save to student list in this format:
StudentID:id, StudentName:name, CourseID:mark
Due to limited time, There are a lot of bugs in this program

start program
1. Add student (must be done or this program will not work reason above)
2. Add course (must be done or this program will not work reason above)
3. Add mark (must be done or this program will not work)(must fill in at least 1 student & 1 course)
4. Display student list

this program will loop until user choose 5 to exit

update:
After having more time for this program, I made an improved version of this program
1.student.mark.improved.py

changes:
1. instead of storing mark in student list, I store it in course list
2. no limit for number of student & course
3. add function to display course list separately

the reason I don't commit it directly to the original program is because one of the requirement is to input number of
students & courses in the beginning of the program which in the improved version is not needed anymore.
